## Secure Data Encryption and Authentication System
This Python script demonstrates two types of encryption systems:

    1. Custom Caesar Cipher
    2. AES-based Secure Encryption with Fernet â€“ uses strong cryptographic standards for secure data handling.

It also implements:
    File handling (encrypt_data.txt)
    User authentication simulation (simple in-memory database)
    Real-time encryption/decryption flow
